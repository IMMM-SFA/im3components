### Statemod to parquet

This class is a prototype method that can convert Statemod output into parquet files separated by structure id with knowledge of sample and realization number for SA experiments. In practice it has been rewritten elsewhere to accomdate experiment specific details.

To do: determine if it will still be useful to have this code here and if so get the latest version.
